# 9.0 Wrap Up

**Congratulations** and **Thank You** for participating in the OpenShift Application Migration Lab.  We hope you have found it to be both informative and thorough. By now you have completed the following activities:

* Familiarized yourself with the CAM WebUI.
* Leveraged CPMA to generate an cluster report.
* Migrated multiple applications (stateless and stateful) from OpenShift 3 to OpenShift 4.
* Performed both Copy and Move operations for handling Persistent Volumes.
* Leveraged the API to migrate multiple namespaces in a single Migration Plan.

We've included a couple of additional applications in the 3.11 cluster deployment (Parks App & Robot Shop). Feel Free to perform migrations of these applications too (time permitting).
