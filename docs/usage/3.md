# 3.0 Migrate MSSQL Application

The first application that we are going to migrate is a simple Product Inventory web-based application front-end, backed backed by Microsoft SQL Server.  This application will deploy into the mssql-example namespace using a single PV backed by NFS for persistent storage.

## 3.1 Deploying the MSSQL app to the _Source Cluster_
First we'll need to deploy the mssql app to our _source cluster_ using yaml from the [mig-demo-apps](https://github.com/konveyor/mig-demo-apps/) repo.
```bash
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konveyor/mig-demo-apps/master/apps/mssql-app/manifest.yaml
```

_Required Container Images - MSSQL Example_
```
quay.io/ocpmigrate/mssql-sample-app:microsoft
quay.io/ocpmigrate/mssql-server:latest
```

After creation, we should see mssql-example come up.

```bash
$ oc get pods -n mssql-example
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-app-deployment-6ffb46c5d6-n5fvv   1/1     Running   0          41m
mssql-deployment-1-xq4p4                1/1     Running   0          41m
```

Let's get the route to the application, and bring up the webUI.

```bash
$ oc get route -n mssql-example
NAME              HOST/PORT                                                       PATH   SERVICES     PORT
mssql-app-route   mssql-app-route-mssql-example.apps.srccluster.com          db-app-svc   5000
```

![MSSQL Product Catalog](./screenshots/lab5/mssql-product-catalog.png)

Let's go ahead and add a new product to the inventory.  Click on the +Add button and enter some data.

![MSSQL Add Product](./screenshots/lab5/mssql-add-product.png)

You can see the application is functioning and state is being saved in the DB.

![MSSQL Added Product](./screenshots/lab5/mssql-added-product.png)

Let's also verify that the application is NOT installed on our _destination_ cluster.  First login to the _destination_ cluster. You can see that no Pods are running; and in fact the mssql-example namespace does *not* exist.

### 3.1.1 Create MSSQL SCC on the _Destination Cluster_

The custom SCC yaml is available [here](./files/mssql-scc.yaml).  Download to your local machine, as we will apply it in the next step.

1. Run the following to recreate the MSSQL `scc` on the _destination cluster_:
```bash
$ oc create -f mssql-scc.yaml
securitycontextconstraints.security.openshift.io/mssql created
```


## 3.2 Using CAM

Next, let's open up the migration UI. Again, to get the route, run the following command on the _destination_ cluster:
```bash
$ oc get routes migration -n openshift-migration -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
 migration-mig.apps.cluster-a21d.a21d.sandbox67.opentlc.com
```

The screen should look something like:

### 3.2.1 Add a Cluster

First thing we want to do is add the source OCP cluster we wish to migrate the
application from. Click `Add cluster`:

![CAM Add Cluster](./screenshots/lab5/cam-add-cluster.png)

Fill out the neccessary information. We will need an Service Account Token in order for _destination_ cluster to talk to _source_ cluster:

`Run the following against your source cluster.`

```bash
$ oc sa get-token mig -n openshift-migration
eyJhbGciOifsfsds8ahmtpZCI6IiJ9fdsfdseyJpc3MiOiJrdWJlcm5ldGVzL3NlcnZpY2VhY2NvdW50Iiwia3ViZXJuZXRlcy5pby9zZXJ2aWNlYWNjb3VudC9uYW1lc3BhY2UiOiJtaWciLCJrdWJlcm5ldGVzLmlvL3NlcnZpY2VhY2NvdW50L3NlY3JldC5uYW1lIjoibWlnLXRva2VuLTdxMnhjIiwia3ViZXJuZXRlcy5pby9zZXJ2aWNlYWNjb3VudC9zZXJ2aWNlLWFjY291bnQubmFtZSI6Im1pZyIsImt1YmVybmss7gc2VydmljZWFjY291bnQvc2VydmljZS1hY2NvdW50LnVpZCI6IjQ5NjYyZjgxLWEzNDItMTFlOS05NGRjLTA2MDlkNjY4OTQyMCIsInN1YiI6InN5c3RlbTpzZXJ2aWNlYWNjb3VudDptaWc6bWlnIn0.Qhcv0cwP539nSxbhIHFNHen0PNXSfLgBiDMFqt6BvHZBLET_UK0FgwyDxnRYRnDAHdxAGHN3dHxVtwhu-idHKI-mKc7KnyNXDfWe5O0c1xWv63BbEvyXnTNvpJuW1ChUGCY04DBb6iuSVcUMi04Jy_sVez00FCQ56xMSFzy5nLW5QpLFiFOTj2k_4Krcjhs8dgf02dgfkkshshjfgfsdfdsfdsa8fdsgdsfd8fasfdaTScsu4lEDSbMY25rbpr-XqhGcGKwnU58qlmtJcBNT3uffKuxAdgbqa-4zt9cLFeyayTKmelc1MLswlOvu3vvJ2soFx9VzWdPbGRMsjZWWLvJ246oyzwykYlBunYJbX3D_uPfyqoKfzA

# We need to save the output of the 'get-token', that is the long string we will enter into the mig-ui when we create a new cluster entry.
```

When done, click `Add Cluster`. You should see a `Connection successful` message. Click `Close`.

![CAM Add Cluster Success](./screenshots/lab5/cam-add-cluster-success.png)

Now you should see the _source_ and _destination_ clusters populated.

![CAM Clusters Added](./screenshots/lab5/cam-clusters-added.png)

### 3.2.2 Setup an S3 bucket as a replication repository

Next we want to add a replication repository, which is an Object Storage endpoint.  Currently we assume this is a `S3 like` endpoint.
If you do not have a Object Storage endpoint ready to use, refer to [ObjectStorage.md](./ObjectStorage.md)

Click `Add Repository`:

![CAM Add Repo](./screenshots/lab5/cam-add-repo.png)

Fill out the information for the S3 bucket you wish to use as S3 scratch space. Click `Add repository` and you should see a `Connection successful` message. Click `Close`.

![CAM Add Repo Success](./screenshots/lab5/cam-add-repo-success.png)

You should now see the repository `myrepo` populated.

![CAM Repo Added](./screenshots/lab5/cam-repo-added.png)

### 3.2.3 Create a Migration Plan

Now that we have a replication repository specified and both the _source_ and
_destination_ clusters defined, we can create a migration plan. Click `Add Plan`:

![CAM Mig Plan 1](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-1.png)

Fill out a plan name. Click Next.

![CAM Mig Plan 2](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-2.png)

Select the source and target cluster, the replication repository, and the `mssql-example` namespace (which we want to migrate over). Click Next.

![CAM Mig Plan 3](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-3.png)

Now we are displayed a list of persistent volumes associated with our
application workload. Select which type of action you would like to perform on the PV. For this example we've selected `copy`.  Click Next.

![CAM Mig Plan 4](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-4.png)

Since we are copying to a new PV, we must select the storage class to be used for creation of new PVs.  In this case we will be copying our data from NFS to AWS-EBS (`gp2:kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`).  Click Next.

![CAM Mig Plan 5](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-5.png)

After validating the migration plan, you will see a `Ready` message and you can click `Close`.

### 3.2.4 Migrate the Application Workload

Now we can select `Migrate` or `Stage` on the application. Since we don't care about downtime for this example, let's select `Migrate`:

![CAM Mig Plan Added](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-added.png)

Optionally choose to *not* terminate the application on the _source cluster_.
Leave it unchecked and select `Migrate`.

![CAM Quiesce](./screenshots/lab5/cam-quiesce.png)

The migration will progress with a progress bar showing each step in the process.

![CAM Progress Bar](./screenshots/lab5/cam-progress-bar.png)

Once done, you should see `Migration Succeeded` on the migration plan.

![CAM Migration Complete](./screenshots/lab5/cam-migration-complete.png)


### 5.2.5 Verify application is functioning on Destination Cluster

Let's check out Pods running in the `mssql-example` namespace on the _destination_ cluster.

First we can check out the Pods running on the destination and verify they meet our expectation.
```bash
$ oc get pods -n mssql-example
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-app-deployment-6ffb46c5d6-n5fvv   1/1     Running   0          5m
mssql-deployment-1-xq4p4                1/1     Running   0          6m
```

Next, let's check for a newly created route on the _destination_ cluster.
```bash
$  oc get route -n mssql-example
NAME              HOST/PORT                                                 PATH   SERVICES
mssql-app-route   mssql-app-route-mssql-example.apps.destcluster.com     db-app-svc   5000
```

Open the route in a browser and verify the mssql demo app is functional.
