# Rollback

MTC allows for rollback of Migration Plans. Rollback can be used to revert namespaces migrated by MTC Migration Plans back to their original states.

## Effects of rollback

Rolling back the migration plan will revert migrated resources and volumes to their original states and locations, including:

**Source Cluster**
- Restoring original replica counts (Un-Quiescing) on:
  - Deployments
  - DeploymentConfigs
  - StatefulSets
  - ReplicaSets
  - DaemonSets
  - CronJobs
  - Jobs

**Target Cluster**
- Deleting migrated resources

**Both Clusters**
- Deleting Velero Backups and Restores created during the migration
- Removing migration annotations and labels from:
  - PVs
  - PVCs
  - Pods
  - ImageStreams
  - Namespaces
  
## Triggering a Rollback

### Rollback from the Web UI

From mig-ui, use the Migration Plan kebab menu (three dots) and click "Rollback". This will prompt you to confirm that you want to rollback all migration
actions taken by the Migration Plan so far.

### Rollback from the CLI

From the CLI, create a new MigMigration as with `rollback` and `stage` set as below. Make sure to set `migPlanRef` to the Migration Plan you want to rollback.

```
spec:
  migPlanRef:
    name: sample-plan
    namespace: openshift-migration
  rollback: true
  stage: false
```

### Monitoring Rollback Progress
A rollback is just another MigMigration resource, so you can monitor it from the Migration UI or CLI just like a normal migration. When viewing from the CLI, you'll
see that `ROLLBACK: true` is visible on a rollback migration.

```
$ oc get migmigration
