# RHTE 2019: OpenShift Cluster Application Migration Lab

This guide will provide you with hands-on exposure to the new OpenShift Migration Tooling through a series of labs migrating application workloads (both stateful and stateless) between OpenShift Clusters.

### Goals

* Migrate several application workloads (both stateful and stateless) from an OpenShift 3.11 cluster to an OpenShift 4.1 cluster using the Cluster Application Migration Tool (CAM)
* Utilize the Control Plane Migration Assistance Tool (CPMA) to generate a detailed report identifying areas of custom configuration that need to be considered as part of application migration planning.
